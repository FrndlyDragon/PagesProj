# Who Am I
Hi, my name is Jordan, and I write and create games. I find games to be that perfect intersection between art, entertainment, and technology. As long as there are computers and there are people, video games will stand the test of time. In a world that seems to grow more and more uncertain and nihilistic, there is an increasing need for people to look somewhere, even if it's just for a moment, to have fun. Some may say escapism is cowardice and that we should stand up and confront the issues abound in the world. I say those people are wrong. In this online world, these issues are thrown at your face day after day, hour after hour. I wish to be there, extending out a digital olive branch to people around the world and give them what I have gotten so often from video games: a reprieve from the real world. 

# What are Video Games
They aren't just a reprieve. Video games can be medium of art. Just like film, literature, and music, games can teach and create moments of introspection in a way that is emotionally impactful and understandable. In modern times, a game like *God of War RagnarÃ¶k* shows just how far video games have come and how much potential there is. Beyond the usual aspects of a video game (combat, exploration, and progression systems) there is a very well written and enjoyable story about a man learning to be a father and to forgive himself for his violent past. A story about a son trying to discover who he is in a world spiraling into chaos. Many themes run through this experience, all shown beautifully with cinematic cutscenes and passionate voicelines all wrapping a neat bow on a wonderful game. 

It is games like these that inspire me. Games like these are what push me forward so that one day I too can reach into someone's heart and tell them something. So that one day I can bring the joy of exploring a new world and escape from the struggles of real life to achieve the impossible in another life. 

# The Struggles of Video Game Development
The thing that makes video games so unique is also what makes their creation so difficult. You have two sides, one that is artistic and another that is logical. This conflict causes issues and creating a video game is like conducting an orchestra where half of the orchestra is reading an avant garde piece and the other is reading some romantic era music. It is through this struggle, though, that amazing ideas can be created. It is through the communication of these parts, between the game designers and the software engineers, that magic is born. 

However, unlike art, there are deadlines. Deadlines established by those more worried about profit margins than the quality and integrity of the software, in this case the game, being created. There's a famous saying that is often attributed to Shigeru Miyamoto.

> A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.

It's a very true saying from my experience both as a consumer and as a developer. However, nowadays more and more companies seem to be taking the position that every game can simply be fixed through future patches. Imagine if this wasn't a game but rather licensed software for various companies. Such a practice would put whoever owns that product out of business, but in the video game industry, especially in the triple A sphere, it is becoming the standard. However, I won't be one to blame only management. There is, of course, the issue of consumers who's words and actions often run counter to each other. For instance, when a buggy game is put out that was likely preordered, people complain about said bugs. But if a game is delayed to fix these bugs, people will complain about said delay. Delays are also on management and giving timelines that are often optimistic which is naive at best. Both consumers and management seem to believe that fixing bugs is as simple as:

```
if (bug == true) {
    bug = false;
}
```

Anyone can tell you that this is not the case. If only it was.

There are a number of other issues but to go over all of them would be time consuming and quite a long read. So let's go over one last issue. The issue of AI.

# AI and Game Development
I have a lot of opinions when it comes to AI. Let me just make it clear: AI is and will be prone to abuse. It should be, first and for most, a tool. It should be an aid to help people be more productive and focus on more creative and/or difficult tasks. Yet, I see the main push for AI is to replace people in the spheres that I believe to be the most human. AI can't and most likely won't replace software engineers or game designers. These require things outside of pure generation of code and text. If AI can advance to such a degree then we may have more issues to worry about then. No, AI is currently being used to replace writers, artists, and musicians.
