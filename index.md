# Who Am I
Hi, my name is Jordan, and I write and create games. I find games to be that perfect intersection between art, entertainment, and technology. As long as there are computers and there are people, video games will stand the test of time. In a world that seems to grow more and more uncertain and nihilistic, there is an increasing need for people to look somewhere, even if it's just for a moment, to have fun. Some may say escapism is cowardice and that we should stand up and confront the issues abound in the world. I say those people are wrong. In this online world, these issues are thrown at your face day after day, hour after hour. I wish to be there, extending out a digital olive branch to people around the world and give them what I have gotten so often from video games: a reprieve from the real world. 

# What are Video Games
They aren't just a reprieve. Video games can be medium of art. Just like film, literature, and music, games can teach and create moments of introspection in a way that is emotionally impactful and understandable. In modern times, a game like *God of War RagnarÃ¶k* shows just how far video games have come and how much potential there is. Beyond the usual aspects of a video game (combat, exploration, and progression systems) there is a very well written and enjoyable story about a man learning to be a father and to forgive himself for his violent past. A story about a son trying to discover who he is in a world spiraling into chaos. Many themes run through this experience, all shown beautifully with cinematic cutscenes and passionate voicelines all wrapping a neat bow on a wonderful game. 

It is games like these that inspire me. Games like these are what push me forward so that one day I too can reach into someone's heart and tell them something. So that one day I can bring the joy of exploring a new world and escape from the struggles of real life to achieve the impossible in another life. 

# The Struggles of Video Game Development
The thing that makes video games so unique is also what makes their creation so difficult. You have two sides, one that is artistic and another that is logical. This conflict causes issues and creating a video game is like conducting an orchestra where half of the orchestra is reading an avant garde piece and the other is reading some romantic era music. It is through this struggle, though, that amazing ideas can be created. It is through the communication of these parts, between the game designers and the software engineers, that magic is born. 

However, unlike art, there are deadlines. Deadlines established by those more worried about profit margins than the quality and integrity of the software, in this case the game, being created. There's a famous saying that is often attributed to Shigeru Miyamoto.

> A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.

It's a very true saying from my experience both as a consumer and as a developer. However, nowadays more and more companies seem to be taking the position that every game can simply be fixed through future patches. Imagine if this wasn't a game but rather licensed software for various companies. Such a practice would put whoever owns that product out of business, but in the video game industry, especially in the triple A sphere, it is becoming the standard. However, I won't be one to blame only management. There is, of course, the issue of consumers who's words and actions often run counter to each other. For instance, when a buggy game is put out that was likely preordered, people complain about said bugs. But if a game is delayed to fix these bugs, people will complain about said delay. Delays are also on management and giving timelines that are often optimistic which is naive at best. Both consumers and management seem to believe that fixing bugs is as simple as:

```
if (bug == true) {
    bug = false;
}
```

Anyone can tell you that this is not the case. If only it was.

There are a number of other issues but to go over all of them would be time consuming and quite a long read. So let's go over one last issue. The issue of AI.

# The AI Issue
I have a lot of opinions when it comes to AI. Let me just make it clear: AI is and will be prone to abuse. It should be, first and for most, a tool. It should be an aid to help people be more productive and focus on more creative and/or difficult tasks. Yet, I see the main push for AI is to replace people in the spheres that I believe to be the most human. AI can't and most likely won't replace software engineers or game designers. These require things outside of pure generation of code and text. If AI can advance to such a degree then we may have more issues to worry about then. No, AI is currently being used to replace writers, artists, and musicians. 

These are the main parts of a game that I can distinguish:
- Sound
- Story
- Art
- Gameplay

Software is used to connect all of these together with artists of various fields creating the assets used. They are important to the process and are what make games the beautiful symphony that they are. Luckily, most likely due to the games industry being more in tune with the fast changing world of technology, most of the influence AI has had on game development is to advance it further with tools used for procedural generation and animation. However, that doesn't change the fact that AI is advancing more and more in the realms that I believe AI shouldn't be prevalent in. The most common of these is the idea of AI art. I see no reason to even have such generative tools. Art is a matter of expression and skill. Letting a model generate something (I hesitate to say create) removes the human element. One might kid themselves and say that they are the artist, skillfully putting in the words. But I ask, does ordering off a menu make you a chef? No one in their right mind would say yes. This is even worse than that though. The prevalent behaviour of those that sing the praises of AI art is more akin to that of someone saying that they can make artisan burgers just as well as a Michelin star chef and then proceeding to show you something they ordered off a fastfood menu.

There is a video that I quite like that is a response to one such proponent of AI art. This video being [A Criticism of Shadiversity's "AI Love Letter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svsTKrdSd7s). Now, one might say that this is just one person and not even someone that should be taken seriously, but the main issue is that he is a representation of the culture surrounding AI art and, to an extent, generative AI when it comes to the creative sphere. It touches on many of the issues I have and the problematic nature of those that whole heartedly endorse this use of generative AI.

Now, from a more software engineering perspective, I believe we have a responsibility to ensure what we create can't and will not be abused. There are ethics that must be followed and, sadly, I find the loudest voices are not the most ethical ones. I believe we should be standing with artists and writers to help them push back against the use of AI to replace them. The dream of AI that I see so many say is that it will do our work for us and let us be free to explore our hobbies. I can really only laugh as I now see it take away those hobbies and instead try to force those that already were pursuing their dreams to do the work that we said that AI would handle. Who could have seen this coming.
